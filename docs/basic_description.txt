Project Concept: "AdultingOS"
A personalized AI assistant that helps young adults navigate life's paperwork and maximize their financial well-being by discovering and applying for relevant benefits, grants, and tax credits.

Core AI-Powered Features
Your project can be built around a few key AI components that directly address the problems you've identified.

Conversational AI & Onboarding:

How it works: Instead of a boring, long sign-up form, a chatbot interface guides the user through creating their profile. It can ask questions conversationally, like "Are you currently a student?", "Do you rent or own your home?", "Have you had a job in the last year?".
AI Technology: Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Dialogue Management. You can build this using frameworks like Rasa, or leverage pre-built platforms from cloud providers.
Personalized Recommendation Engine:

How it works: This is the core of your "benefit finding" feature. Based on the user's profile (age, location, income, student status, family size, etc.), the system recommends a prioritized list of opportunities.
Examples:
A student in a low-income bracket could be matched with the Pell Grant, FAFSA deadlines, and local scholarships.
A recent graduate might be recommended the American Opportunity Tax Credit or student loan interest deduction.
Someone who just lost their job would be guided towards unemployment insurance applications for their specific state.
AI Technology: This is a classic machine learning problem. You can start with a simple rule-based system and evolve it into a more complex model (like a collaborative filtering or classification model) that learns which recommendations are most successful.
Document Analysis & Form Assistance (The "Paperwork" part):

How it works: Users can upload or scan documents (e.g., a T4, W-2, or a school enrollment letter). The AI extracts key information and uses it to pre-fill applications or identify missing information.
Example: A user uploads their W-2. The AI extracts their employer's info, their income, and taxes paid, and can use that data to help them with their tax return or other financial applications.
AI Technology: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) combined with Named Entity Recognition (NER). Services like Google Cloud Vision AI, Amazon Textract, or open-source libraries like Tesseract can handle this.
Phased Project Plan (For Your Capstone Timeline)
A project this ambitious needs to be broken down. Hereâ€™s a possible roadmap to have a "nearly complete" slice of the product by December.

Phase 1: The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) - By late October

Focus: Federal Student Aid & Tax Credits for Students. This is a narrow, high-value starting point for your target audience.
Features:
AI Chatbot Onboarding: Create the conversational profile builder.
Knowledge Base: Manually build a database of the top 10-15 most common federal benefits and tax credits for students (Pell Grant, FAFSA, American Opportunity Credit, etc.).
Rule-Based Recommender: Create a simple engine that matches a user's profile to the items in your knowledge base.
Actionable Checklist: The output for the user should be a simple, clear checklist. E.g., "Recommended for you: [1] Apply for FAFSA (Deadline: ...), [2] Claim American Opportunity Tax Credit on your next tax return."
Phase 2: The "Wow" Factor - By December

Focus: Adding one advanced AI feature and expanding the content.
Features:
Implement Document Analysis: Choose ONE key document to start with. A W-2 is a great choice. Allow a user to upload it, and have the AI extract the income and show it back to them. This demonstrates the powerful OCR/NER capability.
Expand the Knowledge Base: Double the number of benefits in your database, perhaps including a few specific to your state or province to show scalability.
UI/UX Polish: Build a clean, simple web interface for the chatbot and the recommendation checklist.
Monetization Strategy: Freemium Model
This is the most natural fit for your application.

Free Tier:

Access to the recommendation engine for major federal programs.
Deadline reminders for up to 3 applications.
Basic conversational AI support.
Premium Tier ($5/month or $50/year):

Recommendations for state/provincial and local benefits (a much larger, more complex dataset).
Full document analysis and form pre-filling.
Unlimited deadline tracking.
"What-if" scenarios: "What if I earned $5,000 more? How would my benefits change?"
This project is ambitious, but by narrowing the scope for your capstone, you can absolutely create a polished and impressive piece of software that solves a real problem. Good luck
