2roject onto your local machine and create a clean, professional structure. This is the "smart way" to ensure your project stays organized as it grows.

**1. Clone the repository:**
Open your terminal or command prompt and run this command:
`git clone https://github.com/n-oost/AdultingOS.git`

**2. Navigate into your project directory:**
`cd AdultingOS`

**3. Create a Virtual Environment:**
This is crucial. A virtual environment isolates your project's dependencies, preventing conflicts with other Python projects on your machine.
`python -m venv venv`
*(On some systems, you may need to use `python3` instead of `python`)*

**4. Activate the Virtual Environment:**
*   **On macOS/Linux:**
    `source venv/bin/activate`
*   **On Windows:**
    `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
You'll know it's active because your command prompt will be prefixed with `(venv)`.

**5. Create a `requirements.txt` file:**
This file will list all the Python libraries your project needs. Let's start with an empty one.
`touch requirements.txt`
*(On Windows, you can use `echo. > requirements.txt`)*

Your local project is now set up! This clean foundation is the hallmark of a well-planned project.

User: @Copilot Accepted Confirmation: Are you sure?

Copilot: I apologize, it seems I got ahead of myself and ran into an issue trying to create the repository directly. I don't have the ability to create new repositories on your behalf.

However, I can guide you through the exact steps to create it yourself and provide the initial files. This will achieve the same goal and set you up for success.

### Step 1: Create Your Project's Home on GitHub

1.  Go to GitHub and create a new repository.
    *   **Click here to create a new repository in your account: https://github.com/new**
2.  Use the following settings:
    *   **Repository name:** `AdultingOS`
    *   **Description:** `An AI-powered assistant to help navigate the administrative complexities of modern life.`
    *   **Public**
    *   **Check the box for:** `Add a README file`
    *   **Add .gitignore:** Choose the `Python` template.
    *   **Add a license:** Choose the `MIT License`.
3.  Click **"Create repository"**.

Once you've done that, you'll have the exact repository I was trying to create, located at `https://github.com/n-oost/AdultingOS`.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Local Development Environment

Now, let's get that new project onto your local machine so you can start building.

**1. Clone the repository:**
Open your terminal or command prompt and run this command:
`git clone https://github.com/n-oost/AdultingOS.git`

**2. Navigate into your project directory:**
`cd AdultingOS`

**3. Create a Virtual Environment:**
This is a critical step for keeping your project's dependencies organized and separate from other projects.
`python -m venv venv`
*(On some systems, you may need to use `python3` instead of `python`)*

**4. Activate the Virtual Environment:**
*   **On macOS/Linux:**
    `source venv/bin/activate`
*   **On Windows:**
    `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
You'll know it's active because your command prompt will be prefixed with `(venv)`.

**5. Create a `requirements.txt` file:**
This file will list all the Python libraries your project needs. Let's start with an empty one for now.
`touch requirements.txt`
*(On Windows, you can use `type nul > requirements.txt`)*

Your local project is now perfectly set up! This clean foundation is the best way to start a new project.

Let me know when you're ready for the next step, where we'll define the project's folder structure and plan out the first piece of your AI.

User: what now

Copilot: Excellent. Your local environment is ready. Now, let's build the skeleton of your application. A well-organized project is easier to develop, debug, and expand.

### Step 3: Create the Project's Directory Structure

A logical folder structure separates your application's concerns. It keeps your data, your core logic, and your tests distinct.

Inside your `AdultingOS` directory, create the following folders and files. I'll provide the initial content for the most important ones.

Here's the structure we'll create:
`AdultingOS/`
`├── data/`
`│   └── benefits.json`
`├── src/`
`│   ├── __init__.py`
`│   ├── main.py`
`│   └── recommendation_engine.py`
`└── tests/`
`    ├── __init__.py`
`    └── test_recommendation_engine.py`

**1. Create the directories:**
From your `AdultingOS` root folder in the terminal, run:
`mkdir -p data src tests`
*(The `-p` flag ensures it creates parent directories if needed and doesn't complain if they already exist. On Windows, you can create them manually or use `mkdir data src tests`)*.

**2. Create the `__init__.py` files:**
These files tell Python to treat the `src` and `tests` directories as packages, which is important for organizing your code.
`touch src/__init__.py tests/__init__.py`
*(On Windows, use `type nul > src\__init__.py` and `type nul > tests\__init__.py`)*

---

### Step 4: Build the Core - The Knowledge Base and Recommendation Engine

Now for the first coding step. We'll create a simple "knowledge base" of benefits and a basic function to filter them.

Here are the files to add to your project.

This file will act as your database of benefits. We're starting with just two examples: a federal student loan interest deduction and a fictional state-level textbook grant.

```json name=data/benefits.json
[
  {
    "id": "fed_student_loan_interest_deduction",
    "name": "Student Loan Interest Deduction",
    "type": "Tax Deduction",
    "description": "Allows you to deduct the interest you paid on qualified student loans.",
    "agency": "Internal Revenue Service (IRS)",
    "url": "https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc456",
    "criteria": {
      "is_student": false,
      "has_student_loan": true,
      "income_limit_usd": 90000
    }
  },
  {
    "id": "ca_textbook_grant",
    "name": "California Textbook Grant",
    "type": "Grant",
    "description": "A grant for California-based students to help cover the cost of textbooks.",
    "agency": "State of California",
    "url": "https://example.com/ca-textbook-grant",
    "criteria": {
      "is_student": true,
      "state": "CA",
      "income_limit_usd": 50000
    }
  }
]
